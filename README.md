Room Styles
===========

ExtPlug plugin that allows room owners to create their own custom room styles.
It supports both the [plug続](https://github.com/plugCubed/plugCubed/wiki/Room-Settings)
and [RCS](https://rcs.radiant.dj/ccs) room style formats.

## Installation

You can install this plugin by going to your ExtPlug settings menu, pressing "Install Plugin",
and entering this Plugin URL:

```
https://unpkg.com/extplug-room-styles
```

## Room Settings

**Note: This section is intended for room hosts only.**

You can add a custom room style using the plug続 or RCS formats, or even a
mixture of both. If you have already defined a plug続 or RCS room style, you do
not have to do anything to support ExtPlug users.

See the relevant Room Styles documentation for more information.

    In particular, the `css`, `ccc` and `images` properties.

    Note: The RCS custom chat colour (`ccc`) properties `friend` and `user` are
    **not yet supported** by this plugin.
